# Machine Learning - Practical: Clustering applied to a toy example (moving-curve)
All description of this practical, you can find it [here] (https://github.com/stalyn21/toyCurvesWithCluster/blob/main/PracticalsML_Moving_curve_toy_example.pdf).

## Abstract
In this clustering applied to a toy example project, we analyze the formation of clusters on a moving curve setting. The aim of this work is to understand how the clustering process changes and is affected by the different levels of noise. For this, we use K-means clustering technique and we run our algorithms with different values of noise and for a different number of clusters. We show that cluster formation is influenced by the level of noise and the number of clusters.

## Technical resources
To start, we work with GNU/Linux and Windows in ours operating systems, using specifically Arch Linux and Windows 10. Both with the x86_64 architecture. In Arch Linux, we install Octave 5.2.0 and Matlab 2020 A on Windows. To get the similar result in both operating system, we use a seed for generate the same random numbers, [see.m](https://github.com/stalyn21/toyCurvesWithCluster/blob/main/seed.m). On the other hand, the result of the experiments are based on the practices questionnaire. So, we implement the code without the cluster, then, with the cluster (K-means) and its centers. Finally, we assess the robustness of the clustering with Fisherâ€™s Criterion.
